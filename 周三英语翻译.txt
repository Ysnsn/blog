领导力就是让人们尽最大的努力，帮助他们发挥最大的潜力，并激励他们朝着一个共同的目标努力。领导者应该做正确的事情。一个好的领导者，一个有效的领导者，就是尊重他人的人。尊重他人的领导者会发现，尊重也得到了回报。与所有相关人员一起工作的积极性。
Leadership is all about getting people to give their best, helping them to grow to their fullest potential, and motivating them to work toward a common goal. Leaders make the right things happen when they are supposed to. A good leader, an effective leader, is one who has respect for others. A leader who has respect for other people will find that respect is returned. And all concerned will be motivated to work together.
